In the past, manual trading was done using paper certificates. With advancements in machine learning, algorithmic trading has found a base to do real-time transactions
without human involvement. This offers many benefits including high speed, accuracy, and low costs. The trade algorithms are written beforehand and whenever 
the conditions for trade are satisfied, the algorithm automatically instructs the transaction. This can yield a higher profit for traders by conducting the right 
transaction on the right stocks at the right time. It is also independent of human emotions and hence it is not prone to irrational decision-making. 
It also allows back-testing to understand what components of the trade work by utilizing the learnings of the past.

For this project, we are given a $1 million investment amount on a specific day and the goal is to design an algorithmic strategy that produces the best portfolio. 
Historical stock market data are given for reference, and the best portfolio is defined as one that maximizes returns for a given risk level that appeals to a
 risk-averse investor. A few metrics have been chosen to evaluate the overall performance of the trading strategy, including total wealth at the end of the last day,
 the Sharpe Ratio of the portfolio, and the number of days profit is seen in the trading period. 

To achieve this goal, the group proceeded with the below steps:

●	Description of Data: Overview of the most significant fields.
●	Feature Engineering: Creation of 3 additional features along with 11 existing engineered features.
●	Model Algorithms: Selection of the best window and machine learning model for each stock to predict daily return for each day.
●	Trading Strategy: Identification of the best portfolio and strategic decision for buy, sell and hold to maximize the return for the day given the risk.
